# Video Processing Bot

## Overview

This is a Telegram bot built with Pyrogram that provides video processing capabilities. Users can upload videos and perform various operations like trimming, compressing, rotating, adding watermarks, and more. The bot includes a credit system, premium subscriptions, referral program, and admin functionality.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Pyrogram (Python Telegram Bot API)
- **Language**: Python 3.x
- **Architecture Pattern**: Plugin-based modular design
- **Database**: MongoDB with Motor (async driver)
- **File Processing**: FFmpeg for video operations
- **Async Processing**: Uses asyncio for non-blocking operations

### Key Design Decisions
- **Plugin System**: Modular approach with separate files for different functionalities (admin, credits, premium, etc.)
- **Async/Await**: Full async implementation for better performance and concurrent processing
- **Credit System**: Virtual currency system to limit usage and monetize the service
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress updates during video processing operations

## Key Components

### Core Components
1. **bot.py**: Main bot entry point and initialization
2. **config.py**: Configuration management with environment variables
3. **database.py**: MongoDB integration with user management
4. **progress.py**: Progress tracking and user feedback during operations

### Plugin System
- **start.py**: User onboarding and welcome flow
- **video_handler.py**: Main video processing workflow
- **admin.py**: Administrative commands and broadcast functionality
- **credits.py**: Credit system management
- **premium.py**: Premium subscription handling
- **referral.py**: Referral program implementation

### Helper Modules
- **helpers/ffmpeg.py**: Video processing operations using FFmpeg
- **helpers/utils.py**: Utility functions for file operations
- **helpers/watermark.py**: Watermark processing functionality

## Data Flow

### User Registration Flow
1. User sends /start command
2. Bot checks if user exists in database
3. If new user, creates record with default credits
4. Handles referral bonuses if applicable
5. Displays welcome message with available options

### Video Processing Flow
1. User uploads video file
2. Bot validates user permissions and limits
3. Displays processing options (trim, compress, rotate, etc.)
4. User selects operation
5. Bot downloads video, processes with FFmpeg
6. Updates progress in real-time
7. Uploads processed video back to user
8. Deducts credits and updates usage statistics

### Credit System Flow
- Users start with default credits
- Each operation costs configurable credits
- Credits can be earned through referrals
- Premium users get unlimited daily processing
- Admin can manage user credits

## External Dependencies

### Required Services
- **MongoDB**: User data, operations history, premium subscriptions
- **FFmpeg**: Video processing operations
- **Telegram Bot API**: Core bot functionality

### Environment Variables
- `API_ID`, `API_HASH`: Telegram API credentials
- `BOT_TOKEN`: Telegram bot token
- `MONGODB_URI`: MongoDB connection string
- `OWNER_ID`, `ADMINS`: Bot administration
- Various configuration for credits, limits, and pricing

### File System Requirements
- Directories for downloads, uploads, and temporary files
- FFmpeg and FFprobe binaries in system PATH

## Deployment Strategy

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+ environment
- MongoDB instance (local or cloud)
- FFmpeg installation
- Telegram bot token from BotFather

### Environment Setup
1. Install Python dependencies (pyrogram, motor, python-dotenv)
2. Set up MongoDB database
3. Configure environment variables in .env file
4. Ensure FFmpeg is available in system PATH
5. Create necessary directories for file storage

### Running the Bot
- Execute `python bot.py` to start the bot
- Bot will connect to MongoDB and Telegram
- Sends startup notification to configured log channel
- Handles graceful shutdown with cleanup

### Scaling Considerations
- MongoDB can be horizontally scaled
- File storage should be moved to cloud storage for production
- Progress tracking uses in-memory storage (consider Redis for scaling)
- Multiple bot instances would need coordination for shared state
